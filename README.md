## Rules

This is a simple version of the game for 2-4 players. The goal of the game is to get rid of the cards and not be the last player holding cards in their hand, i.e. Durak (The Fool in Russian). 

From the standard 52 card deck, the 2,3,4 and 5 cards are removed, so the final playing deck consists of 36 cards.
